###########  Forex Pattern Predictor  ############

----------PREDICTIONS----------

- Load previous Data
	- Various types of data, not always buy sell price
	- Investigate trend lines used

- Look at previous (currentDataLength) bits of data

- Look at all previous data and compare pattern
	- Various methods for deciding how close
		- ERROR - Method 1: Allow for 0% change in data
	- Option Menu for deciding how close

- For all the similar patterns find the price (predictionDistance) into the future

- Calculate average future price
	- More recent data could be heabily weighted? (Weighting Options)
	- Ignore top 10% of past finish prices? Too Flukey?

- Calculate percentage change of
	- Rise
	- Fall
	- Not much change

- Decide if a trade should be actioned
	- What % chance is acceptable?
	- How many similar patterns should be found before reliable?
	- Actual opening price will be delayed by (decisionTime)
	- Decide buy or sell
		- How long should the purchase be held for?
		- Whilst being held, find new prediction for (predictionDistance) into future
		- Close the trade when appropiate
	- Log open and close price

- Graphing and GUI
	- Show graph of current pattern
	- Show found similar graphs
	- show result of previous graphs
	- number of graphs compared to
	- Percentage above/below


---------BACKTESTING-------------

- Collect predictions for above code and compare to real outcome
- For all suggested Trades calculate Profit / loss

- Simulate running for a (backtestPeriod)

- Calculate profit for given period if trusted completely

--------LEARNING----------

- Possible Variables:
	- Method of comparing patterns
	- complexity of above method changes (decisionTime)
	- backtestPeriod
	- How many similar patterns need to be found to count as reliable?
	- Weighting Options for predictions
		- How recent? How severe?
		- Ignore how many out liers?
		- How conservative? Only ignore profitable outliers?

- Evolution and inheritance?
	- Variable size of off spring?
	- Select two best
	- Breed and generate random variations on each variable
	- could have an infancy stage
		- test all children on a smaller section and kill lowest half before full testing


- Neural Networks?

- Exponetial Growth Theory?
	- Change variable untill only grows profit linearly
	- Cycle through all variables
		- Then carry on till no improved profit???
		- cycle through again
	- Start cycle at different point in different learning cycles

- Evolve the evolution program!!
	- Evolveception
		- Eloveception
			- Eloveception
				- Deloveception
					- ........
